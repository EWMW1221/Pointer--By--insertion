## Student Information -
 **Name**: Eyerus wesene
 **Student ID**: RMNS-4199-/23
 **Course**: DSA
## ALGORITHM
1.Start with the second element (i = 1) in the array of pointers (arr[]).
2.Set the key as the pointer at the current index (arr[i]).
3.Compare the value pointed to by key with the values pointed to by preceding pointers (arr[j]).
4.Shift elements greater than key to the right until the correct position for key is found.
Place the key in its correct position.
5.Repeat steps 2â€“5 for all elements until the end of the array.
6.The array is sorted in ascending order based on the values pointed to by the pointers.
## How to Run the code
1.Clone the repository to your local machine. 
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the repository directory. 
3. Compile the C++ code using: ```bash
g++ main.cpp 
-o main Run the compiled program:
 ./main 
Output 
The program will output:values pointer to by the pointer is 10,20,30,50
